# Database
> So far we're storing our data in a single file where every operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) will get the entire content of that object. It's not efficient when it comes to a larger scale of data.

### CRUD Operations
> It's operations of Create, Read, Update, Delete.

## DBMS - Database Management Systems
> DBMS are software systems optimized for data storage tasks.
1. Optimize simultaneous read / write access.
2. Optimize data storage and retrieval.
3. Optimize data querying with filters and conditions.

## RDBMS - Relational Database Management Systems
> It's also called SQL Databases (Structured Query Language). Store normalized data across multiple tables.
1. Tables have clearly defined schemas and data types
2. All of the values in a column have the same data type
3. Each row is unique

## [Schema](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/sql-tutorial/schema-in-sql#:~:text=In%20a%20SQL%20database%2C%20a,user%20who%20constructs%20the%20object.)
> A Schema is a list of logical structures of data where a database user owns it. In other word, schema are similar to separate namespaces or containers used to handle database files.
### Advantages of Schema
1. A SQL Schema can be easily transferred to other user
2. we gain greater power over the access and protection of database objects
3. It enables you to transfer database objects between schemas.

## Non RDBMS - Non-Relational Database Management Systems
> Also named NoSQL Databases.
1. It has higher scalability
2. Support flexible schema
3. There are no complex relationships between table like RDBMS

## MySQL Server
> MySQL is a RDBMS developed by Oracle based on SQL.

### MySQL Workbench
> It's a GUI software to manage the MySQL Server.
