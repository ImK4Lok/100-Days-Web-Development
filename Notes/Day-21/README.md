## CSS
### Responsive Design

#### Problem with [Pixels](https://dev.to/prashantandani/quick-guide-to-css-units-px-em-rem-4lic#:~:text=Cons%3A,lend%20towards%20missing%20few%20viewports.)
> Pixels are an absolute unit of measure which is fixed in size ( 1px = 1 dot on a device screen). <br/>
> Therefore Pixels cannot be used to build a responsive website.

> All the user preferences of the font-size will be override by the `px` unit.

### Comparing Unites
#### `px`
> Pixels,
> 1. easy to understand & translateable
> 2. limited user focus & not scalable

#### `%`
> Percentage Unit, 
> 1. relative to parent element size - child font-size will determined by the parent font-size
> 2. hard to manage due to cascading nature

#### `em`
> Ephemeral Unit,
> 1. size is relative to font-size
> 2. hard to manage due to cascading nature


#### `rem`
> Root Ephemeral Unit,
> 1. size is relative to root element's font size
> 2. preferred choice if applicable
