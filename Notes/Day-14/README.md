## CSS
### Header
> I take the reference from this [sample](https://codepen.io/joebocock/pen/ZEWoMPb).

> Firstly, for the main div, make it vanish with 0 opacity: `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);` <br/>
> Use the pseudo element `:after` to create the shifted background color. <br/>
> Most importantly, the main div need to have property `position: relation` to make it fit in the correct position.

### Tabs
> The Tab section is mainly referencing from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLqdy95LZSw).

> But it's not all the same, I just want to design the layout, it's not able to switch the page via the tab button.

### Main Content
> The main content div are layout with property `display: grid;` learn from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=318s).

> Also from this [sample](https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/oNXeoZp?editors=1100).
