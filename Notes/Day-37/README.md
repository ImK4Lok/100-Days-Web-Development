### Comparison Operators

---

### Double equals `==`
> It's a comparison operator, it'll transforms the operands having the same type before comparison.

> So, when you compare string with a number, it converts any string to a number.<br/>
For example, an empty string is always zero, a string with no numeric value is NaN (Not a Number).

### Triple equals `===`
> It's a strict equality comparison operator, which returns false for the values which are not of a similar type.<br>
> If the variable values are of different types, then the values are considered as unequal.
