## CSS
### [Margin Collapsing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#adjacent-siblings)
> Margin collapsing means that when a heading with a bottom margin, is followed by a paragraph with a top margin, <br/>
> you do not get a huge gap between those items.

> Margins collapse has three main situations:
> 1. Adjacent siblings
> 2. Completely empty boxes
> 3. Parent and first or last child element

#### Parent - Child Margin Collapsing
> This is because the margin on the child collapses with any margin on the parent thus ending up on the outside of the parent. <br>
> To fix it, you can simply add some padding around the parent container.
