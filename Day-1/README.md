## How does a website work?
> A user send a request to the website's server via a web browser with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator),<br/>
which is the address of the website, then the server side will response and send the code of the website back to the client side.

## The three main programming languages
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
  > Define the structure of the website
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  > Define how things look like
- Javascript
  > Adds interactivity and events

## HTTP & HTTPS
### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
> It's a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange of the Web and it is a client-server protocol,
which means requests are initiated by the recipient [(Link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview).

### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
> HTTPS is HTTP with encryption, HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. 
Instead of the text you can see from the HTTP protocol, you would see a bunch of random characters 
if you fetch the HTTPS traffic with a packet sniffer [(Link)](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/).
